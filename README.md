 - 1 project Booking Hotel Data Analysis:
   
I analyst hotel data containing 23 million rows using Tableau, calculating the average room rate for each room type over a full year. Prices were also analyzed according to the ZD Code to determine the impact of classifications on pricing. Additionally, the number of people who booked each room was calculated, reflecting the popularity of the rooms. This analysis provides valuable insights for improving hotel pricing and planning strategies.

I analyst the company's bicycle user data using Excel, removing duplicates and missing values, and adjusting some values ​​to fit the analysis. I then created charts showing the average number of bicycles per gender, including those who own and do not own bicycles, identifying the age groups most frequently using bicycles, and analyzing the commuting distance covered by bicycle users. These graphical representations helped present the information in a visual and easy-to-understand format.
